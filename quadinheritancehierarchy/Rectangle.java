//Write an inheritance hierarchy for classes  Qadrilateral, Trapezoid,  Parallelogram,  
//Rectangle and Square. Use Quadrilateral as the superclass of the hierarchy. Create and 
//use a Point class to represent the points in each shape. Make the hierarchy as deep 
//(i.e., as many levels) as possible. Specify the instance variables and methods 
//for each class. The private instance variables of Quadrilateral should be the 
//x-y coordinate pairs for the four endpoints of the Quadrilateral. 
//write a program that instantiates objects of your classes and outputs each objectâ€™s area 
//(except Quadrilateral).   The Quadrilateral class is defined below.
